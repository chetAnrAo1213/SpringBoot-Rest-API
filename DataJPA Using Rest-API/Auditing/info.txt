Auditing in Spring Data JPA is a mechanism that helps automatically capture and persist metadata related to entity changes, such as:

1)Creation Information:
Automatically records the user or system who created the entity and the timestamp of when it was created.

2)Modification Information:
Tracks the user or system who last modified the entity and the timestamp of the modification.

Key Uses of Auditing:
Tracking Entity Lifecycle  :     Helps maintain a record of when an entity was created or modified and by whom.
Maintaining Historical Data:     Enables better traceability and accountability in applications that need audit trails (e.g., financial systems, regulatory systems).
Improved Code Efficiency   :     Reduces boilerplate code by automatically handling metadata instead of manually setting creation and update information.
